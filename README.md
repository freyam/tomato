## Soup: Prioritizing AP (Availability and Partition Tolerance) in CAP Theorem for System Design

### Status: Accepted

### Context

As the architect of the OTT (Over-The-Top) platform, we are designing our system architecture to handle the challenges of scalability, fault tolerance, and availability in a distributed environment. The CAP (Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance) theorem states that in a distributed database system, it is impossible to achieve consistency, availability, and partition tolerance simultaneously. Given the nature of our microservices-based architecture, which leverages containerization with Kubernetes and GraphQL for API flexibility, we need to prioritize the AP (Availability and Partition Tolerance) aspect of the CAP theorem to ensure robustness, high availability, and smooth operations of our platform.

### Decision

After careful analysis and consideration, we have decided to prioritize AP (Availability and Partition Tolerance) in the CAP theorem for our OTT platform. This decision aligns with our system requirements and architectural goals, which include high availability, fault tolerance, and scalability. By prioritizing AP, we aim to ensure that our system remains operational and accessible even in the face of network partitions or failures, providing uninterrupted service to our users.

### Consequences

- **Improved Availability**: Prioritizing AP means that our system will remain operational and accessible even during network partitions or failures, minimizing downtime and disruptions and ensuring high availability for our users.
- **Enhanced Fault Tolerance**: By prioritizing partition tolerance, we can design our system to tolerate network partitions and failures, enabling fault tolerance and improving the resilience of our platform.
- **Scalability and Flexibility**: AP aligns well with the microservices-based architecture, containerization with Kubernetes, and GraphQL, as it allows for independent and autonomous operation of microservices, enabling scalability, flexibility, and agility in our system.
- **Resilient Operations**: Prioritizing AP ensures that our system can continue to operate and provide services even in the presence of network partitions, failures, or other unpredictable events, reducing the risk of system-wide failures and ensuring smooth operations.
- **Eventual Consistency**: As AP prioritizes availability and partition tolerance over consistency, our system may exhibit eventual consistency, where updates or changes may take some time to propagate across all replicas or partitions. This may require careful handling of data consistency and synchronization in our microservices-based architecture, and potential challenges in ensuring consistent and coherent views of data across the system.
- **Monitoring and Observability**: Prioritizing AP requires robust monitoring and observability practices to detect and resolve any inconsistencies or issues that may arise due to eventual consistency, network partitions, or failures. This may involve implementing appropriate monitoring tools, logging, tracing, and alerting mechanisms to ensure timely detection and resolution of issues, which may pose challenges in terms of complexity and maintenance.
- **Trade-offs with Consistency**: Prioritizing AP may result in eventual consistency, where different replicas or partitions may have slightly different views of data at any given point in time. This may require careful consideration and trade-offs between consistency and availability in our system, and potential challenges in managing data integrity and consistency across the distributed environment.

# Architectural Tactics and Strategies

## Considerations

- **Contract creation and maintenance**: In a microservices architecture, each service has its own API and contracts that define how it interacts with other services. These contracts need to be created and maintained to ensure that all services can communicate effectively. In the context of a distributed video streaming OTT platform, this means that contracts need to be created and maintained for services such as video encoding, storage, metadata management, and delivery. The contracts should define the format of video files, data structures for metadata, and communication protocols between services.
- **Contract governance**: In a distributed architecture, there are multiple services developed and maintained by different teams or vendors. It's crucial to establish governance policies and procedures to ensure that contracts are followed and updated according to agreed-upon standards. This helps to prevent service disruptions, conflicts, and data inconsistencies. In the context of an OTT platform, this means that governance policies should be in place to ensure that all services are aligned with the platform's performance, security, and compliance requirements.
- **Remote system availability**: In a distributed architecture, services can be deployed across multiple regions or data centers, and each service may have different availability requirements. Ensuring the availability of all services is crucial to maintaining the platform's reliability and performance. In the context of an OTT platform, this means that services such as video encoding and delivery need to be highly available to ensure that users can access and stream videos without interruptions.
- **Remote access authentication and authorization**: In a distributed architecture, services communicate over the network and may be accessed by multiple clients or users. Ensuring secure access to services is crucial to protect against unauthorized access and data breaches. In the context of an OTT platform, this means that authentication and authorization mechanisms should be in place to ensure that only authorized users or services can access and modify video files, metadata, and other sensitive data. This includes secure access to the platform's APIs and content delivery networks.

## Tactics

### Availability

Because we have opted to prioritize availability and partition tolerance over consistency, in compliance with the CAP theorem, we have chosen to sacrifice consistency. To further enhance the availability of Tomato, we suggest implementing the following strategies to either conceal or fix faults, as proposed by Bass et al. (2013).

#### Fault Detection

- Ping/echo messages can be used to check if nodes in the network are functional.
- A monitor can be used to keep track of system health.
- Heartbeats can be used to periodically exchange messages between a system monitor and a monitored process.
- Timestamps can be used to detect incorrect sequences of events in message-passing systems.

- Triple modular redundancy can be used for voting to achieve functional redundancy.
- Exception detection can be used to detect system conditions that alter the normal flow of execution.
- Self-tests can be run periodically by components to check themselves.

#### Fault Recovery

- Exception handling can be used to handle domain-driven exceptions.
- Rollbacks can be used to revert to a previously known stable state.
- Upgradability can be ensured in-service without affecting the service.
- Retrying operations can help overcome transient faults.
- Faulty sources can be identified and faulty behavior can be ignored.
- The system can degrade in case of component failure and prioritize critical functions.
- Escalating restarts can be used to minimize impact on the service.

- NoSQL can be used to follow the BASE guidelines for scalability.
- A predictive model can be used to keep tabs on a process's health.
- Exception prevention can be achieved using exception classes, abstract data types, and wrappers.
- The competence set can be increased by accounting for unlikely occurrences.

### Performance

The objective of performance tactics is to produce timely responses to events that reach the system. In general, the performance scenario can be divided into six variables, as depicted below.

| **Portion of Scenario** |                   **Possible Values**                    |
| :---------------------: | :------------------------------------------------------: |
|   Source of stimulus    |            Internal of external to the system            |
|        Stimulus         |   Arrival of a periodic / sporadic / stochastic event    |
|        Artefact         |    System or a subset of the components in the system    |
|       Environment       | Operational mode: normal, emergency, peak load, overload |
|        Response         |         Process events, change level of service          |
|    Response Measure     |     Latency, deadline, throughput, jitter, miss rate     |

The performance tactics we intend to use are as follows, according to Bass et al. (2013):

|                                                          **Control Resource Demand**                                                          |                                                              **Resource Management**                                                              |
| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
| Manage sampling rate<br>Limit event response<br>Prioritise events<br>Reduce overload<br>Bound execution times<br>Increase resource efficiency | Increase resources<br>Introduce concurrency<br>Maintain multiple copies of computations<br>Maintain multiple copies of data<br>Schedule resources |

#### Control Resource Demand

- Manage sampling rate: We can reduce the sampling frequency of capturing a stream of environmental data, which will reduce the demand on our resources. We can choose different codecs with different sampling rates and data formats to ensure optimal end-user experience.
- Limit event response: To ensure predictable processing when events are actually processed, we can process events only up to a set maximum rate.
- Prioritise events: We can impose a priority scheme that ranks the events according to how important it is to service them.
- Reduce overhead: We can keep intermediaries to a minimum as they increase the resources consumed in processing an event stream. However, they are important for modifiability, so this is a modifiability/performance tradeoff.
- Bound execution times: We can place an upper bound on how much execution time can be devoted to catering to a single event to avoid indefinite computations.
- Improve algorithms: By improving the algorithms used in critical areas, we can decrease latency.

#### Resource Management

- Increase/improve resources: We can identify performance bottlenecks using system diagnostic tools and appropriately upgrade resources such as processors, memory, and networks as the budget permits.
- Introduce concurrency: Processing requests in parallel can reduce blocked time. We can process different streams of events on different threads and create additional threads to process different sets of activities.
- Maintain multiple copies of computations: We can use one-plus-one active redundancy to reduce consensus/fault problems.
- Maintain multiple copies of data: We can use caching to maximise access speeds through a hierarchical memory model. Data will be replicated to resolve conflicts and prevent data loss.
- Schedule resources: Resources such as processors, buffers, and networks will be scheduled using the earliest-deadline-first scheduling strategy.

### Scalability

The need for an improved autoscaling solution arises due to the increasing demand for high-quality video streaming services globally. With the adoption of cloud-based solutions, autoscaling has become a popular choice for scaling resources in response to varying user demands. However, large-scale video streaming platforms like Netflix, Prime, and Hotstar, which cater to millions of users simultaneously, often face issues with traditional autoscaling solutions during sudden spikes in traffic. These spikes can cause a tsunami effect, resulting in increased resource usage and latencies, which traditional autoscaling solutions may not be able to handle. Hence, there is a need for an architectural tactic that can address these issues and improve the overall performance of video streaming platforms.

#### Objective: To handle sudden spikes in traffic and unpredictable user demand in a video streaming platform without incurring high infrastructure costs.

#### Solution: Dynamic autoscaling

- **Data collection**: Collect user traffic and resource utilization data from various sources, such as CDN logs, application logs, monitoring tools, and databases.
- **Data processing**: Analyze the data using machine learning and predictive analytics algorithms to identify patterns and trends in traffic, resource utilization, and user behavior. Develop a prediction model that can forecast traffic demand and resource requirements based on historical data, time of day, day of the week, and other relevant factors.
- **Resource allocation**: Use the prediction model to determine the appropriate number of instances to launch or terminate based on the forecasted demand. Launch additional instances as soon as the traffic starts to increase beyond a certain threshold, and terminate them as soon as the traffic subsides.
- **Load balancing**: Distribute traffic evenly across all instances to avoid overloading any single instance. Use a load balancer that can scale automatically to meet the demand and can route traffic to the most available and optimal instance.
- **Monitoring**: Continuously monitor the performance and health of the instances, and use automated remediation actions to address any issues or failures. Alert the operations team if any instance is underperforming or needs maintenance.
- **Logging and reporting**: Collect and analyze logs and performance metrics to gain insights into the system's behavior, identify any bottlenecks or inefficiencies, and make data-driven decisions for future improvements.

#### Benefits

- **Cost-effective**: The solution can save costs by automatically scaling up or down the infrastructure based on the actual demand, rather than overprovisioning or underprovisioning the resources.
- **Improved user experience**: By handling sudden spikes in traffic and scaling the resources accordingly, the solution can provide a seamless and high-quality user experience, without any buffering or downtime.
- **Scalable and flexible**: The solution can easily adapt to changing traffic patterns and user demand, and can scale up or down the infrastructure as needed, without any manual intervention.
- **Predictive**: By using machine learning and predictive analytics, the solution can forecast traffic demand and resource requirements, and can take proactive actions to prevent any potential issues before they occur.

Overall, the Dynamic Autoscaling with Predictive Analytics tactic can provide a highly scalable, cost-effective, and seamless video streaming platform for users, while also optimizing the infrastructure utilization and minimizing the operational overhead for the operations team.

## Pattern

The proposed architectural solution for the video streaming service involves the adoption of a microservice-based approach, which encompasses several interconnected services, each serving a specific functionality.

- The API Gateway serves as the entry point for client requests, authenticating and authorizing them, and routing them to the appropriate service.
- The User Service manages user authentication and authorization, storing user credentials and performing authentication checks.
- The Video Service manages the video catalogue, storing metadata, handling upload and processing.
- The Encoding Service handles the encoding of video files into different formats and resolutions.
- The Transcoding Service converts video files into different formats suitable for different devices.
- The Streaming Service handles the actual streaming of videos to clients.
- The Analytics Service tracks usage patterns and performance metrics, collecting data about user behavior and system performance.
- The Notification Service sends notifications to users about new videos, comments, and other events.
- The Video Service Provider serves as an interface to interact with various video provider APIs, abstracting their details away from the other services.
- The services are interconnected and orchestrated via the API Gateway to create a robust and scalable microservice architecture to support the video streaming service.

# Architectural Implementation

## Microservice architecture

Our system employs a microservice architecture in which various service providers operate with their individual service handlers, and our platform abstracts the received data from these services into a standardized format. Additionally, we have integrated a video provider service that receives this data and delivers it to end-users. This architecture is designed to enhance scalability and performance by allowing the dynamic scaling of individual components to meet performance demands.

![](./img/microservice.png)

By leveraging microservices, we can achieve a highly modular and loosely coupled design, which enables us to scale our system in a more granular and efficient manner. The microservices provide independent functionality and can be individually managed, monitored, and scaled, which significantly simplifies the maintenance and deployment of our platform.

Our video provider service operates as a gateway between the service providers and the end-users, where it receives all data in a standardized format and processes it for delivery. This approach enables us to seamlessly integrate additional video providers into our platform since each provider is responsible for converting its data to the same format as the other providers, making their integration more manageable.

![](./img/svp.png)

Furthermore, our system's performance is enhanced through the use of load balancing techniques, which evenly distributes traffic across our microservices, allowing for better resource utilization and improved response times. This approach enables us to handle spikes in traffic and ensures that our system remains highly available and responsive to end-users' needs.

## Containers (Docker + Kubernetes)

Our team leveraged Docker containerization technology to streamline the deployment of our application. By containerizing our application, we were able to isolate each service into its own container, enabling us to deploy multiple instances of our services independently in separate containers. This approach allowed us to easily scale our application up or down as per the demand without any disruption to the other services running in the same environment.

Furthermore, the modular architecture of Docker containers enabled us to easily fine-tune the performance of each service by adjusting the resources allocated to each container independently. This level of control over the deployment environment helped us to optimize the application's performance, and ensure that each service could perform at its optimal level.

![](./img/docker.png)

The use of Docker containers also simplified the process of deploying and managing our application, as it enabled us to package all of the application's dependencies into a single container image. This approach streamlined our release process and reduced the risk of version conflicts and dependency issues.

## Graphql

We used Graphql instead of REST API's for our architecture. As we discussed above already, this allows us to specify exactly what data we need in a single request, reducing the number of round-trips and improving performance. It also helps with video service discovery and their integration.

Starting with REST API and then integrating GraphQL later on when the application scales up has several advantages.

Firstly, RESTful APIs are easy to understand, and they have been around for a long time, so there is a lot of documentation and tooling available. This makes it easier to get started quickly and develop the application faster.

Secondly, REST APIs can be optimized for performance using techniques like caching and load balancing. This makes them suitable for smaller applications that do not require the complexity and flexibility of GraphQL.

Lastly, as the application scales up, GraphQL can be integrated to provide more flexibility in data querying and manipulation. This can help to reduce the number of API calls and improve performance, while also making it easier for clients to request the data they need in a single request.

To convert the REST implementation to GraphQL, we need to define a schema that represents the data and operations of our API. Here is one possible schema for the given REST implementation:

```json
type Query {
  providers: [Provider!]!
  provider(name: String!): Provider
  video(provider: String!, filename: String!): Video
  thumbnail(provider: String!, filename: String!): Thumbnail
}

type Provider {
  name: String!
  videos: [Video!]!
  thumbnails: [Thumbnail!]!
}

type Video {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  filename: String!
}

type Thumbnail {
  id: ID!
  filename: String!
}
```

With this schema, we can define the resolvers that implement the functionality of our API:

```js
const resolvers = {
  Query: {
    providers: () => Object.keys(providers).map((name) => ({ name })),
    provider: (parent, args) => {
      const provider = providers[args.name];
      return provider ? { name: args.name, ...provider } : null;
    },
    video: (parent, args) => {
      const provider = providers[args.provider];
      return provider
        ? provider.videos.find((v) => v.filename === args.filename)
        : null;
    },
    thumbnail: (parent, args) => {
      const provider = providers[args.provider];
      return provider
        ? provider.thumbnails.find((t) => t.filename === args.filename)
        : null;
    },
  },
  Provider: {
    videos: (parent) =>
      parent.videos.map((video) => ({ ...video, provider: parent.name })),
    thumbnails: (parent) =>
      parent.thumbnails.map((thumbnail) => ({
        ...thumbnail,
        provider: parent.name,
      })),
  },
  Video: {
    id: (parent) => `${parent.provider}-${parent.id}`,
  },
  Thumbnail: {
    id: (parent) => `${parent.provider}-${parent.id}`,
  },
};
```

We can then use the graphql and express-graphql packages to create a GraphQL server:

```js
const { graphqlHTTP } = require("express-graphql");
const { makeExecutableSchema } = require("@graphql-tools/schema");

const schema = makeExecutableSchema({
  typeDefs: /_ schema definition _/,
  resolvers: /_ resolver functions _/,
});

app.use(
  "/graphql",
  graphqlHTTP({
    schema,
    graphiql: true,
  })
);
```

This creates a GraphQL endpoint at /graphql and enables the GraphiQL IDE for testing and exploring the API. We can now query the API using GraphQL syntax:

```js
query {
  providers {
    name
  }
  provider(name: "Marvel") {
    name
    videos {
      id
      title
      filename
    }
    thumbnails {
      id
      filename
    }
  }
  video(provider: "Marvel", filename: "ironman.mp4") {
    id
    title
    filename
  }
  thumbnail(provider: "Marvel", filename: "ironman.jpg") {
    id
    filename
  }
}
```

## Availability and Partition Tolerance

Microservice architectures are inherently fault-tolerant, with each service designed to be independently deployable and replaceable. Since each service is designed to be independent and can operate even if other services are not available, the overall system can continue to operate even if network partitions occur. Also, if a service fails, other services can continue to operate. This will ensure the availability of the application to the users.

# Architectural Evaluation

- Part of the system being analyzed: Video content providing part of the system
- Quality attributes being analyzed: Availability, performance, and scalability
- Comparison pattern used: Microservice architecture vs. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) with a service registry
- Results of the analysis
  - Availability
    - Microservice architecture: When one service fails, it does not affect other services or the whole application
    - SOA architecture: One service failure can cause a cascade of failures due to the dependency on the ESB.
  - Scalability
    - Microservice architecture: Allows for dynamic scaling of individual components according to load, whereas SOA requires scaling the whole application or ESB which is costly and inefficient.
  - Performance
    - Microservice architecture: Provides faster response times and lower latency by avoiding the overhead of the ESB.
    - SOA architecture: Performance is slower due to the ESB's overhead.
  - Security
    - Microservice architecture: Allows for fine-grained access control and encryption mechanisms for each service, enhancing the security of the video streaming service.
    - SOA architecture: Cannot provide fine-grained security mechanisms for each service.
- Inference from the analysis: Microservice architecture is better suited for the application as it provides better availability, scalability, performance, and security than SOA.
